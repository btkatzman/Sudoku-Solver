# Sudoku-Solver
This program solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle, where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all the digits from 1 to 9. This program efficiently finds solutions to Sudoku puzzles by exploring possible number placements and backtracking when a conflict is detected.
